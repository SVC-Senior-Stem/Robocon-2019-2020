How to use this repo:

There will be final file containing all the code we are going to use in the master branch.
This should only be pushed to when we are 100% certain on a piece of code

When you want to make changes or test stuff, create a branch. When you are happy with your changes, submit a pull request.
We can then discuss and finalise changes.
